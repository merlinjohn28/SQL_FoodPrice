# SQL_FoodPrice

File " **foodprices1.csv** " is a dataset containing the data of Indian Food Prices (1994 - 2022) sourced from the World Food Programme (WFP) database.

I downloaded this vast dataset from the online community platform. Since this original file comprises of 172017 records, it took me a long to download. Hence, I have also uploaded a smaller file " **foodprices.csv** ", that comprises of only 7443 records.

File " **foodprices.sql** " contains the sql queries to 15 questions, executed on MySQL WorkBench 8.0.31
